This is our first demo for our rendition of Slay the Spire. All .java files are available in the Demo 1 branch, 
but the demo can be run more easily using the jar file, STS_demo1.jar, also located in the Demo 1 branch. 
This file can be used in command prompt using the command: java -jar STS_demo.jar

Update, new class attribute to handle entity attributes such as the rate at which a stat is modified for use with poison or health regen,
And skill was created to make a new kind of card that uses these attributes.
