This is our third demo for our rendition of Slay the Spire. To compile, ensure that all packages are located in a single folder, navigate
to that folder, then type "javac buttonHandlers/*.java game/*.java logic/*.java -cp buttonHandlers;logic;game;files".
After compiling, you may run the code with: "java game.Game" or "java game.GameGUI".
